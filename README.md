# DL-wine-quality
BeCode's solo challenge - Using machine learning and deep learning to predict the wine quality.

The first model I made, I treated the categories just as that : categories.
I got an accuracy of 55,04 percent only, and I was not satisfied. 

So, I made a second one, this time treating the category as a linear value, and then round it to get the actual 'category'.
This time, I got an accuracy of 76,94, so, much better.

3 layers is where I got the better results.

I put 150 epochs, since after that (400-500 epochs), my model started slightly overfitting. Even if it didn't change the output, I could see it with a higher accurancy on the training set than on the actual testing set.


### Objectives
- Use a deep learning library (I choose Keras)
- Prepare a data set for a deep learning model
- Put together a simple neural network
- Tune parameters of a neural network


### When
- Deadline: 18/01/2021 16:30
- Duration: 1 day
- Situation: Beginning of the deep learning course


### Where
All the work done was made during the BeCode's AI's formation 2020-2021.


### Progress
Finished
